# Dotfiles (A.K.A lonefiles)

=======

[![Demo](https://github.com/shahzadlone/lonefiles/blob/master/media/demo.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpsW9i991Fw)

This repository is to be used as a bare git repo, I will have a bunch of installation
 scripts that build dependencies, clone these dotfiles, configure all my packages and
 plugins, change my default terminal to my theme and then map all my keys according
 to my preference (caps-lock to control when held and escape if tapped).
